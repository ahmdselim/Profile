          I grew up in Cairo / Qalyubia, Cuba. After getting my hands wet with
          Web Development I discovered my passion for it. Now I live in Al
          Qanatir Al Khayriyyah where I&apos;ve been doing freelance for small
          businesses and helping them with SEO.
        </p>
        <p>
          I really enjoy working with building sites but since I love improving
          my self, I have been focusing on React js, mainly redux and the
          context Api.
